# Clipboard Accelerator
A tool to integrate many of your frequently used utilities. Executing those with text from the clipboard as parameter makes it very quick and convenient to use them.

#### About the tool ####
Clipboard Accelerator provides a user defined list of external commands which can be executed with text from the clipboard / free text as parameter.

Adding user defined external commands is easy. Either create a simple .BAT / .CMD file calling your desired command and parameters or create a simple .XML file which provides more execution options like pre-defined optional parameters.

The tool monitors for clipboard changes and saves text on the clipboard in a clipboard history. The clipboard history only preserves plain text for the duration of the execution of the tool. Saving the clipboard text history might be added in a later version.
