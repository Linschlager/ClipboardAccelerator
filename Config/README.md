# About the config directory
In the current version the "config" directory contains only one file called "RegEx.xml".
The directory must be located in the same directory as the programs executable.
The file "RegEx.xml" is used for highlighting certain entries in the external commands listbox. The file maps regular expression class name. Class names can also be assigned to external programs in the XML file describing the external program. If text from the clipboard match a regular expression the class name is used to highlight all external programs that have the same class name assigned.
